# Pansharpening

These codes are based on IDL 8.7.2 and ENVI 5.5.2.

This version is the earliest version meaning this version has the least adjustment with only Modulation Transfer Function and Generalized Laplacian Pyramid (MTF-GLP), High Pass Filtering (HPF), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

However, the codes have been personally tested to meet the nearest requirements as in:

Since this is the initial version, some further adjustment might be needed. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you find one. My email address is nur.ichsan@gmail.com.

Best wishes,
