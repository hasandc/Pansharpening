# Pansharpening

These codes are based on IDL 8.7.2 and ENVI 5.5.2 under Win 10 Home (64bit).

The main code is run_program.pro by 
    ENVI> run_program
or press the run button under run_program.pro in the primary focused tab.

The codes have been personally tested to meet the nearest requirements as in: 
http://openremotesensing.net/knowledgebase/a-critical-comparison-among-pansharpening-algorithms/

This version is the initial version meaning this version has the least adjustment with only Modulation Transfer Function and Generalized Laplacian Pyramid (MTF-GLP), High Pass Filtering (HPF), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Since this is the initial version, some further adjustment might be needed. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you find one. My email address is nur.ichsan@gmail.com.

Best wishes,
